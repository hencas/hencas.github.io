							<h2><p>Sample for a chapter opening</p></h2>
							<p>The downpour threatened to drown the city. Or so Heather imagined as the windshield wiper fought against the onslaught of raindrops. Together with the dark sky of a December evening and the ever-forming ponds over the city outskirts' broken lane, Heather could be told she was driving over the ocean and outright believe it. As a singular guidance to her almost blind driving, she followed the red and blue siren of a police car in the distance, a lighthouse to another corpse.</p>
							<p>She slowed the car the closer she got it to the crime scene, noticing the increasing number of people in the streets and the multiple vans with the logos of a plethora of TV stations. After a quick sigh of annoyance, Heather parked her car a couple of meters away from the house that had been surrounded by yellow tape from top to bottom.</p>
							<p>Heather turned the interior lights on and glanced at the rearview mirror. Under her hazel eyes, dark bags had formed, and her pupils seemed somehow pale. <i>I certainly hope Chief Derenger won't be here, or he might get even more curious. He can't know,</i> Heather thought as she opened the glovebox where some mint drops and her almost empty makeup were hidden behind used tissues.</p>
							<h2><p>Sample for a crime scene description</p></h2>
							<p>Water invaded the room's interior, leaking in through cracks in the ceiling, with each drop echoing inside the empty rooms. Even the flies couldn't survive here; their corpses littered sections of the floor despite how small they were. Dust, easily perceived in the air when seen passing in front of the light equipment, gathered in mounts at every surface. Breathing evolved into a difficult activity once Heather took a step further into the house; the stagnant air prevented the corpse's smell from being carried away, adding to the horror that was just being there, witnessing that disgusting crime scene.</p>
							<p>At the center of it all, where no gaze could ever hope to escape, was a corpse with an iron mask illuminated by police light stands. Unlike the previous two, this one wasn't hanging on the wall; instead, his body laid on the floor, as if he was half sitting, half standing. The legs were curved in an unnatural position, one bent forward to the left, and one backwards. The man's skin had a hue trapped between red and black, but it once was white. </p>
							<p>Yet, the blood circle was present, painted behind with the same pattern seen at the previous crime scenes. It was undeniably a part of the Scarlet Murderers.</p>
