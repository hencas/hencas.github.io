							<p>Ghostwriting is an odd job to discuss as more often than not, you can't show much, if anything, for it! Due to strict NDAs and to keep the privacy of my customers, I’m only allowed to divulge some testimonials and generic information regarding the books I’ve worked on.
</p>
							<p>During my time ghostwriting, I've worked on projects of varied lengths, usually between 50000 to 120000 words. Topics and genres included Science Fiction and Fantasy as my primary focus, but I occasionally explored mystery/thriller, Historical Fiction, romance, or a mix of them all. Beyond books, I also assisted customers with creating outlines, ensuring they could visualize their book even before the writing process began.
</p>
							<p>With around 20 projects completed in the past two years (most of which were done within Dibbly || The Urban Writers platform under the pen name <i>H. G. Kennedy</i>), many of which were full-blown series, I’ve acqueried a lot fo experience in the publishing world, creating a writing direction aimed at a successful release! Not only did I not cancel a single project, I also managed to retain a 5 star review rating on the aforementioned platform!
</p>
							<p>Please, refer to my <a href="samples.html">samples page</a> to get a taste of my writing style or the <a href="reviews.html">testimonials page</a> to learn what my customers had to say about me!
