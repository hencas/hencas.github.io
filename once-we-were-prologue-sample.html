							<h2>Prologue - Echoes of Broken skies</h2>
							<blockquote><p>The sound echoed across the planet, and even without a single word, it spoke in every language: “We failed.”</p></blockquote>
							<p>Thunder struck as the ball pen coined the final dot of the sentence.  Yet, nothing seemed to be heard.</p>
							<p>The blonde, tired man spun the pen between his fingers, thinking about what to write next. As he formulated the next sentences in his mind, he gave a strong bite to an already heavily munched pen cover.</p>
							<p>The sky screamed with another thunder strike as if it had been bitten too. Yet, the man seemed not to hear it. From his perspective, the sound wasn't even there, but rather blending with the world, as unnoticeable as the action of breathing.</p>
							<blockquote>
							<p>My memory now embellishes the scene. I lost control of myself the second I heard the sound of the asteroid shattering into pieces.  My legs could do nothing but run outside my fairly small home and deep into the large, vibrant green fields around it. The color of the grass seemed out of place when compared to the dark, overcast sky sitting above it.</p>
							<p>The sound of debris collapsing grew stronger and stronger, breeding anticipation for what would come next. My heart followed every crack in the space rock beat by beat.</p>
							<p>Suddenly, a flaming rock parted the clouds, acting as a spear tip that pierced the heavens downwards, screaming during its descent.</p>
							<p>But the flames didn’t burn in bright red. They were alien in nature. They called it magenta now, but back then, my eyes saw it only as purple.</p>
							<p>Plumes of smoke left a dark trace where the asteroid piece passed by. A savage thunderstorm took place inside the column of smoke, despite it seeming illogical due to its size and nature.</p>
							<p>As it continued its entry, the chunk of rock slowly dissolved into small particles. The dust refused to follow the asteroid’s fall or obey gravity, meshing into the clouds to never leave the upper atmosphere, leaving a translucent purple where it travelled.</p>
							<p>Yet, the massive object seemed to never lose its mass..</p>
							<p>I waited, and waited to see what would unfold. Anticipation conquered my very being. And then, there was another sound. This one stopped my heart and tricked my ears, for I swear I could hear the souls of the dead screaming after dying to the impact.</p>
							<p>I lost my footing. Everything trembled, cracking the floor of the plains and my house’s walls as if they were paper-thin.</p>
							<p>A wave of expanding heated air followed the seismic shock. It embraced everything that came in contact with it, lifting so much soil and minerals that my lungs couldn’t take it. It all felt like the asteroid had fallen just by my house, but in truth, I would learn that it had destroyed another state.</p>
							<p>I had nowhere to run, and my eyes were burning with dust cloud entering them, but my gaze could not be averted. The view of the clouds opening as more and more rocks kept on falling, pretending that they were Moses parting the Red Sea, was far too a unique sight to behold. To me, God was sending a message.</p>
							<p>Little did I know that I would never see the normal sky again. And that no one would ever dare to throw a rock.</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>“What are you doing, Eric?” Asked a young man dressed in a green army uniform with a rifle strapped to his back. Although the uniform resembled the usual military outfit, the quality of the cloth was nowhere closer to the real thing. Since it did the job, Mark was proud of wearing it. His dark blonde hair had a military cut to accompany the clothing.</p>
							<p>“Writing… well, a biography, I guess,” Eric replied while putting the pen away in his pocket and closing his notebook. He sat on a rock covered by overgrown roots of a coniferous forest. Unlike the young man beside him, he wore simple civilian clothes, making the rifle on the floor the single indication of their association.</p>
							<p>“Never took you for an author,” Mark replied. “Is there anything in your life that is worth telling?” The constant humming of electricity in the air and the roar of thunder partially covered his words. It was the first reminder of what everyday life on the planet had become.</p>
							<p>An odd, faint purple glow spilled from the sky, changing what once could be a dark night into an eternal twilight. Reality now had a filter applied over it.</p>
							<p>“Well, not now. But who knows what the future will bring?” Talking of the future was strange considering that Eric was in his forties and the world wasn’t kind to people at that age any longer.</p>
							<p>“A daily dose of electricity and bad news?” Mark's reply sounded like an attempt at a joke, but it contained far too much truth to be funny. It was hard to know, considering his strong, squared jaw tended to emote the opposite of what his intonation was</p>
							<p>A flock of birds chirped away a sad song, indicating their passage above the trees. Eric and his friend looked up in an attempt to spot them through the foliage. Instead, all they saw was the ever-present night’s electrical storm formed from the dust particles that had settled on the upper atmosphere. They emanated electricity from themselves, zapping rays to one another, under a hue of luminescent magenta. Chunks of debris orbited Earth as a ring, but they were barely visible, and so were the stars beyond.</p>
							<p>There were no clouds, no moon, no satellites, or planes. Just electricity that encompassed all.</p>
							<p>Somewhere in the distance, the sound of something falling and breaking branches evaded the deafening sky. Without a single sentence told to one another, the two men rushed towards it. Eric grabbed the rifle from the ground before sprinting away from his uncomfortable seat. </p>
							<p>They didn’t need to run far. Just meters away, at their feet, they found a dead red-winged blackbird lying on the ground. Eric kneeled and took it into his hands gently, even though it would make no difference to the animal if he had been rough.</p>
							<p>“Maybe lightning struck it?” Mark proposed. His green eyes seemed to indicate that he knew that the answer to the question was likely something else.</p>
							<p>“No signs of burn. All I can see is the damage from the fall,” Eric replied as he carefully analyzed the bird.</p>
							<p>With his free hand, Erick took a flashlight that had been carefully strapped to his belt. That was an item that everyone carried at all times.</p>
							<p>When he turned it on, instead of a normal white light, a bluish color called cyan came off. Wherever he pointed the light at, little dust particles that were invisible seconds ago began to shine in a gradient from blue to purple, painting the air itself with their presence.</p>
							<p>He focused the ray of light on the bird’s corpse. Like magic, a luminescent dark blue and magenta mark sprang to life underneath its feather, growing in the lithe animal’s skin like a rash. </p>
							<p>“Same symptoms as many others. This one is also infected,” Eric said with sadness.</p>
							<p>“One moment you’re alright and the next, you’re falling out of the sky.” Mark wanted to lift the mood, but once again, he failed.</p>
							<p>Thunder struck, but once again, it wasn’t heard, even though the flash of the lightning had been seen.</p>
							<p>“ Maybe the rumors are true. Something about the threshold and genetics…” Eric’s words carried a sense of doom.</p>
							<p>"But they got the data from rodents and other animals. Not us, right?” Mark kneeled. “ I mean, I heard about the babies, but… I don’t want to believe that they are born weaker. The next generation might live less than ours just because of this whole threshold, and that seems like crazy talk! Don’t you agree?"</p>
							<p>"I—" The flashlight’s cyan light briefly illuminated Eric’s arm, and the same luminescent mark appeared on his skin. It didn’t move, and yet, it appeared to be alive, colonizing his arm like a fungus.</p>
							<p>“Have they ever told you your threshold? I hope—” Whatever Mark was about to say, the radio on his uniform interrupted him.</p>
							<p>“Mark, do you copy? How is Sector 5?” the voice on the radio spoke over a strong static noise.</p>
							<p>“Sorry, Travis,” Mark answered as fast as he could. “Eric and I finished the search 10 minutes ago. Nothing on Sector 5 but dead birds.”</p>
							<p>“Nothing new under the sunless sky, I see,”  the voice of Travis spoke on the radio. “If you’re near the cliff, be careful. Elysium will be submerging soon. It might get dangerous if you don’t watch your footing.”</p>
							<p>“Copy that, Travis!” Mark replied..</p>
							<p><i>So, is it finally time?</i> Eric asked himself. <i>I can’t be here when the perfect view is so close by.</i></p>
							<p>Eric felt a rush of energy take control of him. He returned the little red-winged blackbird’s corpse to the ground where he found it and turned off his flashlight. With no warning to his friend, he stood up and marched at a steady pace through the forest with a mission given to himself. Soon, he arrived at a clearing just meters away from a cliff overlooking the ocean and a large stretch of coast starting about a kilometer below.</p>
							<p>The coast was almost unnatural at this point, having merged with metal by human hands to create a factory that extended far away from the shallow area around the coast. But that wasn’t the most impressive thing Eric laid eyes on. It was a dark, circular-shaped structure partially submerged in the ocean. It was just as tall as many buildings, with a radius that could fit five entire cities inside it </p>
							<p>It mattered not to Eric that pylons in the factory collect electricity from thunder strikes at regular intervals, whose flashes could make him take a step too far and fall to his death. Neither did it matter the sound of alarms that kept on ringing non-stop, something that could deafen him,  or people's irritating footstep noises that traveled across the valley as they rushed from place to place in the middle of what was one of the most important moments in human history. The danger was worth it.</p>
							<p>“I guess the whole 'be careful with the cliffs' meant nothing, huh?” Mark asked when he finally caught up to Eric.</p>
							<p>“Come on, this is history in the making! I got to see it to put it in my book!” Eric pointed at a bridge retracting from the circular structure. The monstrous human creation had now been freed from the land section.</p>
							<p>A final siren rang. The glass dome at the top of the structure began to disappear under some metallic shell. One by one, metal clanging from engines turning on reverberated across the region.</p>
							<p>The body of water around the circular dome started to move, creating waves that crashed against the cliff Eric stood on. But he didn’t flinch like he did when the asteroid connected with Earth. His gaze observed what was a future unseen.</p>
							<p>“Wishing you could be inside that?” Mark waved his hand in front of Eric’s eyes to catch his attention.</p>
							<p>“No. What would they need me for? I’m just a simple farmer, and they are… the future. Scientists and all that.” Erick continued to watch the entire structure slowly vanish into the ocean, memorizing every second as if they were the frame of a movie he had watched far too many times.</p>
							<p>“Scientists or not, they still need food. Which a farmer can produce,” Mark replied with a smile. “Unless you see yourself as a writer now,” he followed with a smirk on his face.</p>
							<p>“That is not what I meant.” Eric finally took his eyes away from the event unfolding in front of him to briefly glance at the wedding ring on his finger. “I just think everyone outside will need me far more than they ever will.” </p>
							<p>The cliff underneath Eric’s feet shook ever stronger as the crashing waves grew larger. He took a step away from the edge and sat in an area he felt safe. There, his pen and his notebook became the focus of his attention.</p>
							<blockquote>
							<p>The moment I saw Elysium-1 submerging reminded me of the feeling I had when I saw the rocket launching skyward to save us from imminent extinction.</p>
							<p>It wasn’t exactly hope, but pride in witnessing such a large-scale event. Not that hope wasn’t present. I had this idea that one day I would be able to see the sky as it was meant to be. Hope is such an interesting thing, isn’t it? It would take years for all those scientists and engineers to come up with a solution, and even longer till it could be fully implemented, but the fight we started when the asteroid showed up with this strange matter was not yet lost; this was just another step on it.</p>
							<p>For now,  I’ll do what I can out here. That way, on the day I eventually meet my wife and son again… whatever you go after death… they can be proud of me. They’ll know that despite the fact that I missed them both so much, there was joy to protect in this dying world, and I would not let go of it.</p>
							<p>“From the book <i>'Echoes of….'</i> Chapter 1, by Eric Monroe,” written over three centuries ago.</p>
