							<br>
							<h2>Chapter 1: When You Wish Upon Falling Dust</h2>
							<br>
							<br>
							<p>Hope was a feeling that indulged delusion.</p>
							<p>For a brief moment, one could believe it was possible to make out the shape of the real world from within the blurred, water-stained glass dome. It was a fruitless effort. Unless you were one of the unlucky few allowed to go outside, the stains would always be on the way.</p>
							<p>Yet, that never stopped people from gazing, trying to make sense of what they saw. After all, for a brief moment, they would see purple strains falling from the sky, making them believe that because they knew for certain what that was, they could infer everything else.</p>
							<p>A father and his son sat atop a metal tower that overlooked a completely metallic city. A dome of glass trapped them in such a lifeless place, separating the two from the ocean waters and what seemed like islands on the distant horizon. Outside, colors in abundance heated the world; inside, the cold view of gray walls was slightly brightened by the fading light of a distant sunset.</p>
							<p><i>This is our last sunset together</i>>, Kaidan thought, fully aware that his son would be thinking the same thing.</p>
							<p>As usual, the eternal magenta dust that covered the atmosphere kept falling from the sky. Each grain was energized to a point that a trace of light followed behind it. They were falling stars of thunder, made visible by the coming of the night.</p>
							<p>“Alright, I’ve made my wish!” Kaidan’s son shouted with enthusiasm</p>
							<p>“Are you still going on about it?” Kaidan asked with a strong and confident voice that perfectly mirrored his physique. His black eyes reflected the sun bathing the distant lands, creating the perception of a hopeful man. But they also carried a small hint of sadness as if the dome’s dark interior siphoned any dream one could ever have.</p>
							<p>“I know they are not shooting stars, but we can pretend, can’t we?” the boy said with embarrassment.</p>
							<p>From his seated position, Kaidan extended his arm, reaching his son. He placed his hand on top of the boy’s head, switching his gaze from the outside world to the young one’s dark eyes. </p>
							<p><i>He knows that I’m leaving. What do I do now? What do I say?</i> Kaidan wanted to say the next set of words even before agreeing to come here, but they continued to get stuck in his throat.</p>
							<p>“You know, that no matter what, I have to do this right?” Kaidan said with a soft voice, pushing out a question that carried far more weight than it might suggest. At least for him, of course. For the world at large, this question was meaningless.</p>
							<p>“Well, actually, I asked for something different,” the boy proudly announced as if there were more than two of present to listen..</p>
							<p>“R–Really? Then what did you wish for?” Kaidan’s voice cracked for a moment, but he couldn't let it show.</p>
							<p>“I can’t tell. That is the rule, y’know?” The little one crossed his arms before winking at his father.</p>
							<p>Kaidan smiled back, feeling proud and slightly relieved, realizing that maybe all his worries were for naught.</p>
							<p>“Listen, Sean—"</p>
							<p>An infernally loud sound of metal sliding over metal interrupted Kaidan, shortly followed by an announcement. “Elysium-3’s dome will be closing at the usual time, but due to special circumstances, it will only submerge around 0100 hours. Please, all personnel, ensure to be in position and complete your duties at the scheduled hour. This won’t endanger the colony further than needed.” The broadcast concluded with another abrupt noise of machinery echoing inside Elysium-3.</p>
							<p>Kaidan stood up and pulled his son as close as possible to him. He knew what was about to happen wouldn’t do them any harm, but his instincts called for it.</p>
							<p>From a privileged position, the two watched the closure of Elysium-3’s outer shell. Slowly but surely, the lid removed what was already a small amount of sunlight from inside the city. </p>
							<p>Mere seconds later, all that passed through the glass dome was a single sliver of light, growing thinner and thinner by the second. As if demanded by a god, the sliver of light passed right through where the tower was located, leaving the two as the last witnesses to the sunlight.</p>
							<p>Then, only darkness remained; the city vanishing from view. A bitter cold settled in while embraced by this bottomless pit of nothingness, making seconds feel like years.</p>
							<p>The strange black uniforms the two wore came to life. Some traces of fluorescent cyan light emerged from the strips present over their shoulders, chests, arms, and legs. </p>
							<p>A soft hum that permeated the air slowly grew in volume from the city’s center.</p>
							<p>Silence merged with the darkness, but it didn’t last as long. Light returned to the city center, emanating a powerful cyan glow. Like a rock thrown at a perfectly still water surface, the light propagated like waves from the epicenter, lighting every sector it passed by,  eventually reaching the bent walls that formed the circular shape of the dome.</p>
							<p>The temperature fell, causing Kaidan to shiver. Steam came out of his mouth, dancing to the rhythm of the cold that wasn’t there just a moment ago.</p>
							<p>“Hey, why don’t we warm up with a run to the lab? Before dinn— ” Sean pushed Kaidan away before he could finish the sentence and raced ahead, unwilling to listen to the rest.</p>
							<p><i>We won’t have dinner together again, will we?</i></p>
							<p><b>*****</b></p>
							<p>Water continued to drip from the closed lid, meeting its end as each drop hit the glass dome, creating a sound that spilled through Elysium-3. Truth be told, every sound propagated in there. There was a synchronicity to the footsteps of people running their daily errands, to the point that they became predictable. The lamps vibrated, generating a low hum that eternally permeated the air. Laughter was uncommon; silence was even more. Being eternally aware that something was going on—and where— was nothing out of the expected.</p>
							<p>The temperature had stabilized by the time Kaidan and Sean made their run across the housing sector.</p>
							<p>The houses were small and uninteresting: Simple, cold cubes that, similar to everything else, were made of the same colorless metal, steel. Most of them were empty, but there was an effort to care for any inhabited domicile—if one could call them that. It didn’t help that every was drenched in this horrid, blue hue light that made reality boring to look at.</p>
							<p>“Hey, Dad, look!” Sean called out to Kaidan from afar. The boy had been allowed to run ahead so that Kaidan could think over what to say when the time to part ways finally came to pass.  </p>
							<p>“What is it?” Kaidan asked as he approached his son.</p>
							<p>Sean pointed to a cloud of mosquitoes flying around a cyan streetlamp. Faint, but very noticeable, luminescent dark blue marks were present on the dastardly creature.</p>
							<p>“Should we do something? Mr. Corbyn will be— " Before Sean could finish the sentence, Kaidan squashed the small cloud of mosquitoes with his hands. “Wow!” He expressed with far more surprise than Kaidan had anticipated.</p>
							<p>“Just give me a sec.” Kaidan prepared to interact with something akin to a flat-screen strapped around his left wrist when Sean scolded him.</p>
							<p>“No, no, no! I’ll do the report, I learned how last week.”</p>
							<p><i>Oh yeah, you learn this kind of thing when you turn six. I wish you didn't need to</i>, Kaidan murmured in his mind. “Alright then, by all means…”</p>
							<p>Sean had no such apparatus on his wrist, but no one needed to. Every intersection had a pillar with a touchscreen device annexed to it. Sean walked towards the nearest one and fumbled with it.</p>
							<p>“Done! Now Mr. Corbyn has a clue of where invaders can be!”</p>
							<p>“Great job! Keep as much Dust out of the colony, and we might guarantee another generation to live as long as we.”</p>
							<p>“Yeah, but… Y’know… I don’t like killing things. It’s not their fault that they were infected.” Sean seemed reluctant to express his feelings.</p>
							<p>“Sometimes there is no helping it. No matter how good your intentions are, we, people, must always come first. It isn’t evil to kill when we are under threat.” Kaidan wasn’t sure if those were the right words to say to someone so young.</p>
							<p>Sean thought for a second before asking, “But, you’re leaving to save everyone, right? Like, not only us, but everyone? Mosquitoes included?”</p>
							<p>“That is what I hope to do.” Now, it was Kaind who stopped for a second, uncertain of how to divulge the notion of killing as a good thing to his son and the nature of his appointed mission. “It’s a little more complicated than that, but we’ll cross that bridge when you’re older.”</p>
							<p>“We will?” Sean asked, concerned.. “The threshold will…” But the boy refused to continue the thought. "I want to see the flower one last time. Can we go now?"</p>
							<p><i> Older… I need to think more before speaking</i>.</p>
							<p><b>*****</b></p>
							<p>When compared to any other section that composed Elysium-3, none was larger than the Research and Development Zone, save for the Engine and Systems Zone that extended underneath the street level across the entire colony. The zone’s interior was unique, composed of extensive fields of grass, trees capable of bearing a diverse lineup of fruits, and farms growing as many different crops as it was possible within such an environment..</p>
							<p>It was also the place where people reminded themselves that humans weren’t the only creatures on Earth. Bugs were kept for study inside glass containers, dogs barked under the control of their trainers, birds sang their songs from inside giant cages. All in all, there was a freedom not seen underneath the sky of steel and glass—even if each animal had to be free inside their own cage, but so were humans after all.</p>
							<p>When the sounds and view  of life merged with the smell of flowers, earth, and wet grass, Elysium-3 became less of a well-oiled machine and evolved into a location that felt lived in.Sadly, one had to vist the area to experience it, and not many had access to do so.</p>
							<p>After passing through the decontamination chamber that barricaded the entrance, Kaidan and Sean followed a small patch of dirty road that guided them to the main building, ignoring the actual street used by electric vehicles to move resources around. Not that anyone would need any guidance from a road to reach the research center, considering how hard it was not to see the large, cylindrical structure towering over the farms.</p>
							<p>After some time underneath a tree where they could breath the closest thing to fresh air, father and son walked inside the research center. No matter how often Kaidan visited the place, the sterile interior continued to felt like visiting another world. The whole building consisted of a single room, colored entirely in white on white and… more white.They had tables and workstations with no division between them but some empty space and some occasional lab machines.</p>
							<p>One thing stood out from the rest, and for its importance, it got to be placed at the center of the room, where everyone could marvel at it during work hours. It was a tube with three unique flowers whose petals were half white and half blue, capturing the gaze of all. From a distance, some could use the stalk to call the flower a lotus, but its inner notch and large leaves resembled a water lily. That lack of water inside the tube indicated it was neither of those things. This flower was a creation of men, not of nature.</p>
							<p>A woman stared at the flowers as if communicating with them. Her hand touched the glass with a gesture that indicated a desire to pass through it.  She had long black hair with two intricate braids at the sides, falling in front of her shoulders. Another braid circling the top of her head, complementing the main two. Her dress code seemed inappropriate for both the facility they were in, but for Elysium-3 itself, wearing a simple white dress filled with light blue flowery patterns at the gown's edge, complemented by a blue belt around her waist.</p>
							<p>Next to her was a blonde man in a lab coat. His glasses and more serious posture gave the woman the image of an alien—of something that doesn’t belong in such a rigid location.</p>
							<p>“Aya!” Sean screamed, running to give the woman a strong hug.</p>
							<p>“Heyo! Is it ready?” The little one asked enthusiastically just moments before marking the glass tube with the print of his fingers.</p>
							<p>“Yes,” Ayane replied. “Look at the flower, it’s changing color like Lance expected!”</p>
							<p>“That is awesome! Mr. Lance would be so proud!!” Sean said with wide eyes. He was young, but he could understand the weight of the world benignly carried by the plant in front of him.</p>
							<p>“Indeed, he would," Ayane agreed. “I can show you something else." Ayane turned her attention to a computer attached to the tube’s base and interacted with it in search of something.”You will love it when it's ready!”</p>
							<p>“Speaking of things being ready," the blond man approached Kaidan, taking him away from Sean’s and Ayane's conversation, “how is the team doing, Kaidan? Are they all set? I’m only asking because I heard Thomas has been giving some trouble.</p>
							<p>Rutgers was a very practical kind of man who had been entrusted not simply with finishing Lance’s project, but also be taking care of Sean once Kaidan departed for the mission. In a sense, he was the most important person in this room other than the little boy.</p>
							<p>“We are as ready as we can be,” Kaidan replied. “Tom kind of came to terms with the decision. Kind of. Although, to be fair, I would like to have the knife back. It’d be a nice gift to Sean when he is older, but I figure it might be more useful in the outside world.”</p>
							<p>“Don’t worry, I don’t plan to let you leave the city without it. I still don’t exactly know how the rings work, but I managed to make due,” Rutgers said. “I wanted to use this rare opportunity to bring have some new technology brought in, or at least some kind of explanation of the synchronization rings, but… some things refuse to change.”</p>
							<p>Kaidan obliged, having his attention fixated on the tube. A faint cyan light had turned on inside it, revealing Dust particles floating about. The catch was that only a very small portion of them contained the usual color characteristic of the strange matter—the dark blue to magenta hues: Everything else appeared as nothing but, well, dust.</p>
							<p>The flowers had become the main spectacle, though. The blue section of their petals had acquired a strain of fluorescent hue.</p>
							<p>Ayane looked at Rutgers, clutched her fists in front of her chest, and lowered her head before asking, “Do you think everything I’ve learned will be enough? Three months isn't that much.”</p>
							<p>“Well, they’ve permitted you to go out. If that isn’t trust, I don’t know what it is," Rutgers replied.</p>
							<p>“I was just thinking that— ”Ayane was abruptly interrupted by Kaidan gently hitting her forehead with a snap of fingers. “Hey!”</p>
							<p>“Don’t think, just do it”. Kaidan might’ve told this, looking at her eyes, but his mind was on Sean. “Don’t think…”</p>
							<p>“You can do it, aya! I belçieve in you!” Sean said with vigor.</p>
							<p>“Come, Ayane, let’s prepare the seeds for the mission. The sooner we do this, the better.” Rutgers pushed Ayane away from them and cut the conversation short. “I’ll get your knife, too.”</p>
							<p>“Meet you at the exit then," Ayane told Kaidan as she was whisked away.</p>
							<p><i>The exit? Yes, at the exit… don’t think, just do it.</i>.</p>
							<p><b>*****</b></p>
							<p>The warm ocean breeze entered through Elysium-3's open shell door, bringing in figments of Dust that came to life once the cyan light of the city’s interior touched them. A ship filled with cargo containers was connected to it through a precarious docking platform that wobbled with the crashing waves, weaker as they were that evening.</p>
							<p>Something strange hummed in the air, a sound Kaidan had never heard before. It was accompanied by sudden flashes of light that invaded Elysium-3’s open section. That shell door wasn’t simply a door at this point, but a portal to what felt like another dimension.</p>
							<p>Right by the entrance to this brave new world were two young men who stood tall with proud chests held high and hands at their backs. They wore all-black uniforms composed of heavy military trousers, a shirt, and an open jacket, all marked with dark green lines followed by straps that called forth the ever-present cyan light.</p>
							<p>“Everything has been done as requested, sir!” said the blonde one with explosive enthusiasm. Kaidan noticed his failed attempts to control a smile from breaking the soldier's facade.</p>
							<p>Sean watched from the side, mesmerized by the strange sounds and flashes that came in from the outside world. The young boy moved his head left and right in an attempt to catch a glimpse of the infamous electrical night sky. Despite everyone inside Elysium-3 knowing of its existence, few had ever observed it, so any sort of curiosity was to be expected. It was the price to pay for safety against the Dust, creating a colony that would spend months underwater, occasionally emerging for less than a day to avoid any sort of electrical interference from above. Even repairs on the other shell had to be carefully executed during the daytime, with a schedule so consistent that any required repair would be small and fast.</p>
							<p>“I imagine you secured a place for us to stay the night, Dylan?” Kaidan asked straight away, as he saw Dust particles floating about Dylan’s face.</p>
							<p>Dylan wasn’t the strongest of soldiers, which was compensated for by his height, being just a little too tall for someone who had just turned eighteen. He was lean and had some muscles, but nothing to boast about. The blond hair had grown beyond the point a soldier would keep it, but considering their circumstances and Dylan’s personality, Kaidan decided not to mention it.</p>
							<p>“Yes, sir!” Dylan promptly replied. “I’ve also guaranteed a trip to the tower tomorrow morning. The islanders were eager to help.” Dylan’s pale blue eyes followed a magenta Dust particle floating in front of his almost triangular-shaped face. He blew it away with the strength of someone who believed to be blowing death itself to a far-off land.</p>
							<p>“Good work, as usual, soldier,” Kaidan told Dylan just before turning to the other member of his group. “What about you, Thomas? Everything sorted? “</p>
							<p>“Yes, sir! Weapons, supplies, and clothes were moved onto the boat." Kaidan had trouble hearing what he said. Not because of the raging hum of the electrical storm outside, but because Tom had no desire to speak. His high, somewhat curled black hair had grown completely out of control, and the same could be said of his posture, which seemed to struggle to keep his chest held high. Disinterest at its finest.</p>
							<p>“You could at least show some interest in yourself,” Kaidan addressed Tom’s hair. “I’m sorry that you had no choice in whether you’d come to this mission or not—you just happened to be one of the youngest available. But think about the weight you’re carrying right now. I only have one year left to live. If I fail, you pick up the mission—”</p>
							<p>“I know you’re going to die, you don’t need to remember me,” Tom interrupted Kaidan, which one shouldn’t do to his superior officer. “Sorry, sir—that was uncalled for. If you think I’m here because I’m being forced to, then you’re getting this all wrong.”</p>
							<p>“Then explain yourself Tom—mas, why are you here?” Kaidan almost broke protocol and used a nickname. Not that this would matter soon enough. Once they were out of Elysium-3, most things would certainly change. He had a feeling about it.</p>
							<p>“Is that an order?” Tom asked. is dark blue eyes looked lively for a second.</p>
							<p>“Yes,” Kaidan replied instantly. “I don’t want you behaving like this for the next year or so. It could be dangerous for the mission.”</p>
							<p>“I–I can’t put into words, sir.” Tom turned away from Kaidan, ignoring the command. It was easy to do so, as he had a large, strong build, with wide shoulders and large muscles, even though they weren’t as big as Kaidan's.</p>
							<p>“When we arrive, we will discuss this further. But don’t think you can behave like you want just because it's me. Understood? There will be consequences,” Kaidan asked, and Tom replied with a nod.</p>
							<p>The magnificent sound of a powerful thunder roared inside Elysium-3, prompting Sean to run towards Dylan with genuine excitement rather than fear.</p>
							<p>“Hey, Mr. Dylan, did you see the mountain from close by? Did you see the storm above?” The young boy moved his head to the left, trying to see past Dylan and into the outside world.</p>
							<p>“Oh, yes, I did— ”</p>
							<p>“Cool! Was it big? It seems like a huge blob from here,” Sean said, bursting with energy.</p>
							<p>“Indeed, it was. Way taller than the Lookout Tower… Well, way taller than this place! The dome is nothing compared to it!” Dylan broke out of the soldier persona and used his hands to show how tall one was when compared to the other.</p>
							<p>“Dad, could you promise me something? Would you climb the mountain and plant a flag on it? I heard people do that for some reason!” Sean couldn’t control his excitement.</p>
							<p>“Is that an order, soldier?” Kaidan asked the energetic kid.</p>
							<p>“Yes, you bet it is, Dad!” Sean saluted as if giving Kaidan a command.</p>
							<p>“I’m ready!” Ayane’s voice originated from behind Kaidan, breaking the conversation.</p>
							<p>When he turned to her, he saw something he thought impossible: her usual dress was no more, and instead, she wore a completely different attire. Ayane had changed into the same uniform as the other soldiers, but with orange stripes rather than green. She also carried two small items strapped around her waist: A satchel filled with seeds and a glass case with a flower. Perhaps more surprising was the lack of her usual braids.</p>
							<p><i>Who would’ve thought I’d live to see a Misho Pristess dressed like a normal person? Seeing is believing, as they say.  Lance would be proud of her…</i></p>
							<p>”Welcome to the team. Officially, now.” Kaidan called Ayane to the boy's side, which she obliged with quick steps.</p>
							<p>He watched her movements carefully, staggered with what he was seeing. It felt like looking at a completely different person. Especially because she seemed to struggle to walk now that her legs were inside a pair of trousers rather than free under a dress.</p>
							<p>Rutgers—who had arrived with her—approached Sean and gave something to the boy, who quickly hid whatever it was behind his little back and out of Kaidan’s sight.. The scene made Kaidan’s heart skip a beat, as he knew Rutgers would now be taking care of his son, and seeing the two interact made him both jealous and aware that the time he dreaded had arrived.</p>
							<p>“This is for you,” Rutgers gave Kaidan a white, small, flat, wide, metallic case. </p>
							<p>Kaidan held the back end of the case and pulled it, revealing that the entire area was the handle for an incredibly thin knife. Kaidan applied pressure on the handle, which in turn caused a small vibration that originated from small rings located inside the handle.</p>
							<p>“Thank you, Rutgers. I’ll test first thing in the morning.” Kaidan holstered the knife and strapped on his belt, just behind his lower back. </p>
							<p>“I’ll pray for your mission’s success. And I’ll take good care of Sean for you,” Rutgers’s words cut Kaidan’s heart open. There was no going back now.</p>
							<p>“We have to get going,” shouted a voice from the boat, with an accent far too different from Elisium-3 citizens. “Those waters aren’t safe at night.”</p>
							<p>“Alright, everyone, let's proceed into the boat.” Kaidan gave the order with all the strength he could muster, knowing that this would be the order that would set him apart from Sean forever.</p>
							<p>One step was taken towards the shell door. Then another. And then a third. Eventually, Kaidan’s team had passed through the shell door and entered the world outside, but he remained inside, just mere meters away from the exit. He turned his gaze away from this horrid portal and gave a final look at Elysium-3’s interior.</p>
							<p><i>No one came to bid us farewell… everyone is carrying their duty</i>, No one came to bid us farewell… everyone is carrying their duty, he thought to himself, noticing that even this moment was treated just like another day underneath the sky of glass and metal.</p>
							<p>He then turned to Sean.</p>
							<p><i>What should I say now? Is there anything to say?</i></p>
							<p>“You’re already a hero,” Sean timidly said, getting closer to his father.</p>
							<p>“Huh?” Kaidan didn’t understand the line.</p>
							<p>“My wish. It was that you’d be a hero and clear the skies so fast, that you’d be back here in a heartbeat. So one year wouldn’t pass… And you wouldn’t need to worry about your threshold…....” Sean stopped for a second. “Telling you my wish makes it impossible to become reality, but… There is nothing to make true, you're already a hero!” It was clear as day how difficult it was for him to let those thoughts out; the boy held back the tears that were fighting their way out through a cracking voice.</p>
							<p>“Sean—”</p>
							<p>“Could you do something for me?” Sean continued, revealing the item he had kept behind him since Rutgers' arrival: A book. The cover— made with brown leather and adorned with the image of the world map— had a little belt strapping it close.</p>
							<p>“A book?” Kaidan questioned, surprised. There was no means to produce paper inside Elysium-3 without several problems that affected the infrastructure, let alone finding leather..</p>
							<p>“I’ll give you this, so then you can write or glue stuff from your journey. At the end, if you send it back, I’ll know everything you’ve been through. It will be, like, if we were together,” Sean said, pretending to be joyful. “I’ll follow in your footsteps and visit every place you write about. Like the mountain, if you climb it! I promise!”</p>
							<p>Kaidan took the book from Sean’s hands, set it aside for a second, and gave the boy the biggest hug he could give. </p>
							<p>Worlds began to flow out of his mouth, as if he finally understood what needed to be said.“Take care, baby boy. I wish this could be done in under a year, but the world is far too big. I hope that once all we’ll do is said and done, you’ll live a life longer than mine. No thresholds, no countdowns. No one should ever know how long they have left to live. That future will be my gift to you.”</p>
